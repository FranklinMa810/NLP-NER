So if you drill into your phone, you're just going to ruin it. It's not a \"life hack.\"\n\nInternet pranksters are making viral memes suggesting that users take an electric drill to their new devices. And unfortunately, some people say they're falling for it.\n\nThe video from TechRax at the bottom of this post has been viewed 11 million times, and the original concept started as a meme on 4chan.\n\nThere's no evidence that people are actually ruining their new Apple products, unless you count YouTube comments as proof.\n\nIf you're still curious about what's actually behind the speaker grill where the headphone jack used to be, you don't have to ruin your new device. A piece of plastic containing a \"barometric vent\" is hidden behind the metal.\n\nAgain, the following images and video are fake. They're pranks. Please don't do this.\n\nJoin the conversation about this story  \n\nNOW WATCH: Samsung now says it's too dangerous to even turn on your Galaxy Note 7", "category": "tech", "title": "Please don't drill a hole in your iPhone 7 (AAPL)"}
