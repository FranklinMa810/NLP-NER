According to the New York Times, Apple s seen a retention problem with its car initiative, as Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly fired dozens of people on the project, which has shifted focus from an electric vehicle to an autonomous car.\n\nWith McLaren under its hood, Apple would have a loss-making machine on its hands. The company reportedly lost about 22.6 million British pounds in 2014. It would also, however, have a large team of automotive engineers and patents, as well as valuable research, manufacturing and data analyses.\n\nUPDATE: A spokesman for McLaren Technology Group has said that the luxury automaker is not in talks with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) about a possible takeover.\n\nAccording to the official statement from McLaren,  We can confirm that McLaren is not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment. \n\nAnd that s all it says.\n\nHowever, the Financial Times, via a tweet, says it s still backing its story despite the report.\n\nAs of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.", "category": "tech", "title": "Apple Inc. May Buy British Luxury Carmaker McLaren (AAPL)"}
