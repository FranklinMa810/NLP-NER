(NASDAQ:AAPL) and\u00a0Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) after a top analyst investigates the iPhone 7\u2019s in-store availability and an analyst details feature highlights from an executive conference and an analyst day, respectively. Let\u2019s take a closer look:\n\nPiper Jaffray top analyst Gene Munster offers perspective on Apple after 134 in-store iPhone 7 availability checks have indicated 20% of stock keeping units (SKUs) checked were available in-store to be picked up, with an iPhone 7 majority\u00a0compared to\u00a0the iPhone 7 Plus.\n\nMunster believes inventory data points align with the tech giant\u2019s commentary regarding the iPhone 7 Plus selling out before the launch and mirrors that of a \u201ctypical of a number-change phone launch.\u201d The analyst noted \u201cWe view the data as positive given some negative point of sale data reported on Friday. We remain positive on shares of AAPL on our continued belief in an iPhone 7 cycle in-line with iPhone 6 and up mid-teens y/y vs the iPhone 6S.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Munster notes a third party data service expressed on Friday that weekend sales for the newest iPhone launch had fallen 25% year-over-year \u201cin a basket of launch countries\u201d when assessing point of sale data.\n\nNonetheless, \u201cWhile the stock reacted negatively, we believe that point of sale would have been impacted by the fact that Apple had essentially zero iPhone 7 Plus units available for retail purchase in the launch weekend, while there were negligible iPhone 6 inventory constraints last launch. We also note the data does not correlate with positive commentary and Apple\u2019s own commentary about stock outs, which we view as a more reliable indicator of demand,\u201d Munster concludes.\n\nAs such, the analyst reiterates an Overweight rating on shares of AAPL with a $151 price target, which represents a nearly 35% increase from where the stock is currently trading.\n\nAs usual, we like to include the analyst\u2019s track record when reporting on new analyst notes to give a perspective on the effect it has on stock performance. According to TipRanks, top five-star analyst Gene Munster has achieved a high ranking of #4 out of 4,183 analysts. Munster upholds a 68% success rate and yields 19.1% in his annual returns. When recommending AAPL, Munster earns 12.5% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics demonstrate AAPL as a Strong Buy. Based on 36 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 31 rate a Buy on AAPL, 4 maintain a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month price target stands at $127.83, marking a 13% upside from where the shares last closed.\n\nLast week, Oracle Corporation\u00a0hosted its Oracle OpenWorld 2016 conference, where its executives, partners, and leading industry experts share insight into Oracle Cloud, customer success in the cloud, and forthcoming enterprise opportunities. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison asserted that he expects \u201cthe best years of Oracle are in front of it\u201d and predicts the upcoming years will be \u201cvery, very exciting\u201d ones indeed.\n\nDrexel Hamilton analyst Brian White \u201cwalked away encouraged by Oracle\u2019s cloud progress, new product announcements and future direction,\u201d and therefore reiterates a Buy rating on ORCL with a price target of $47, which represents a 21% increase from where the shares last closed.\n\nWhite underscores, \u201cRecall, Oracle is trying to become the first cloud company to reach $10 billion in SaaS/PaaS revenue. In our view, the \u201ccloudification\u201d of Oracle provides for a larger market opportunity, higher levels of recurring revenue, attractive margins and the potential for market share gains.\u201d\n\nAt the conference, the software giant introduced \u201cmore robust\u201d platform-as-a-service (PaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions, which White anticipates will \u201cprovide the necessary arsenal for the Oracle Cloud to take on AWS.\u201d White notes a greater focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a \u201ckey theme\u201d at the conference, with a defense for why ORCL\u2019s database portfolio outclasses that of AWS. ORCL is not sitting still and announced an allegedly 11.5 times faster-than-AWS Generation 2 Infrastructure that also is 20% lesser expensive.\n\nThough ORCL\u2019s chief attention is on battling AWS, the analyst notes the company also recognizes cloud players like Workday (SaaS), Salesforce (SaaS), together with Microsoft (PaaS) as big rivals.\n\nFurthermore, the company intends to use its Accelerated Buying Experience that commenced in the third quarter of the fiscal year of 2016 to make buying cloud solutions for customers an easier process than before.\n\nWhite remains bullish on Oracle\u2019s future, believing, \u201cthe shift of customer workloads into the cloud will allow Oracle to capture a much larger TAM as the company sells all three layers of the cloud.\u201d\n\nAccording to TipRanks, five-star analyst Brian White is ranked #118 out of 4,183 analysts. White has a 59% success rate and gains 8.9% in his yearly returns. However, when recommending OCRL, White loses 1.9% in average profits on the stock.\n\nTipRanks analytics exhibit ORCL as a Buy. Based on 28 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 19 rate a Buy on ORCL, 7 maintain a Hold, while 2 issue a Sell. The consensus price target stands at $44.83, marking a 15% upside from where the stock is currently trading.", "category": "tech", "title": "Analysts Delve Into Apple Inc.
