The Federal Reserve\u2019s inaction on interest rates is largely responsible for the rally \u2014 because who doesn\u2019t like easy money? \u2014 though key reports on August manufacturing and North American oil-rig counts as well as speeches from several Federal Reserve speakers have added a layer of pressure in the early going.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, futures on the\u00a0Dow Jones Industrial Average have tripped 0.07% lower, while S&P 500 dropped 0.14% and Nasdaq-100 futures have slipped 0.15%.\n\nThursday\u2019s options activity remained well above average heading into the expiration of weekly September 23 series contracts. Overall, an above-average 17.6 million calls and 14.5 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio retreated to 0.57, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.65.\n\nUnderpinning Thursday\u2019s options volume, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) was upgraded again \u2014 not just once, but twice \u2014 on Thursday due to iPhone 7 preorder strength. Elsewhere, General Electric Company (NYSE: ) saw unusual options activity in the October and January 2017 series that appeared to be a diagonal calendar spread. Finally, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: ) drummed up chatter this week after it overtook Chinese rival Baidu Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ: ) on ad revenue.\n\nApple bulls had more to cheer about yesterday after not one, but two brokerage firms lifted their price targets on the shares. RBC Capital boosted AAPL stock from $120 to $125 and reiterated its \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the shares, while Nomura lifted AAPL to $135 from $120 while restating its \u201cbuy\u201d rating.\n\nBoth brokerage firms cited strong preorders for the iPhone 7, with Nomura citing healthy data points from the U.S., U.K. and Japan, while RBC highlighted significant upside to the iPhone 7\u2019s selling price due to a shift toward the larger model.\n\nJudging by options activity on AAPL this week, traders\u2019 enthusiasm may finally be dying down a bit. Specifically, calls have accounted for increasingly less of AAPL\u2019s total daily volume as the weeks have worn on. On Thursday, total volume came in at 983,000 contracts, with calls only accounting for about 61% of the day\u2019s take \u2014 down from 63% yesterday and 71% shortly after last week\u2019s iPhone 7 preorder data hit the Street.\n\nWhile declining daily call volume by itself isn\u2019t a major concern for AAPL bulls, rising put open interest could be a warning sign. As I noted yesterday, AAPL\u2019s near-term put/call open interest ratio has been on the rise, and currently rests at 0.90 \u2014 which is somewhat high, historically, for AAPL.\n\nDespite a lack of headline news to drive activity, General Electric stock still cracked the top ten most active options list on Thursday. Total volume jumped to more than 203,000 contracts, with a surge in put volume to 80% of the day\u2019s take underscoring the session\u2019s activity. A closer look GE\u2019s put activity yesterday, via Trade-Alert.com, reveals what appears to be a diagonal calendar spread.\n\nSpecifically, a block of 15,000 GE January 2017 $28 strike puts traded for the ask price of 54 cents, while another block of 15,000 October $30 strike puts crossed at the bid price of 49 cents. Assuming the trades are related, the total outlay for this neutral short-term/bearish long-term spread comes in at 5 cents, or $5 per pair of contracts. In short, the trader is looking for GE to hold steady until the end of the year before dropping, or a sharp rise in implied volatility for GE options.\n\nAlibaba options traders had something else to crow about yesterday after reports broke that the Chinese e-commerce giant had overtaken rival Baidu in ad revenue. The feat is none-too-small either, considering that Baidu is widely regarded as the Chinese Google (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ). Explosive growth in mobile advertising was the catalyst for Alibaba\u2019s rise to prominence, marking a major shift in the Chinese internet market.\n\nOptions volume was unusually strong for BABA on Thursday. Total volume came in at 576,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 77% of the day\u2019s take. If this trend takes hold on BABA, it could also mark a shift in sentiment for the stock. Currently, the September/October put/call open interest ratio for BABA rests at 0.93, with calls and puts nearing parity.\n\nHowever, a turn toward calls could push this ratio lower, indicating bullish expectations for the speculative options crowd.\n\nAs of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.", "category": "tech", "title": "Friday\u2019s Vital Data: Apple (AAPL), General Electric (GE) and Alibaba (BABA)"}
