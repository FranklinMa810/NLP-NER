(NASDAQ:AAPL) deserves to be under the microscope from time to time. But if we don\u2019t step back to look at the big picture once in a while, we could lose perspective on what makes Apple stock (AAPL) so great.\n\nFor instance, a lot of analysts started whining when \u201ciPhone\u201d sales began to fall. They acted like it was the end of AAPL stock. So I took a closer look at the company, expecting to see it in a state of decay. What I found was shocking.\n\nApple stock isn\u2019t dead. It isn\u2019t even injured. The drop in iPhone sales may look pretty bad at close range, but remember to take a step back. Look at the big picture. Apple still has the key ingredient to success, but most analysts won\u2019t even talk about that because it doesn\u2019t make for a dramatic headline.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: AAPL stock is driven by an \u201cecosystem\u201d unlike anything else in the tech sector. I would say that Amazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is coming close with its \u201cPrime\u201d membership, but they still haven\u2019t eclipsed Apple\u2019s dominance. It is the ultimate safeguard to Apple stock, thus the reason why I\u2019m still bullish on AAPL stock.\n\nBut before we get into the details, let\u2019s address the question: what in the world is an \u201cecosystem?\u201d Think about it this way. If you live in the same neighborhood for a few years, you tend to develop a network. Your local dentist. Your local mechanic. Your accountant. Lawyer. Grocer. The list goes on and on.\n\nThat is your\u00a0ecosystem. The more connections you have, the less inclined you are to move away from that neighborhood. Tech companies use the same principle to create an attachment between you and their products. No one is better at this than Apple, which means AAPL stock is protected from harm.\n\nIf this sounds too vague, then it\u2019s time I prove it to you.\n\nThere are over 1 billion Apple devices on a planet with only 7 billion people. It is the most successful consumer electronics company of all time, primarily because Steve Jobs knew how to lock customers into the Apple ecosystem.\n\nThe strength of the ecosystem has become clear after Apple released its latest iPhone.\n\nAt first, the new iPhone garnered a ton of criticism about the removal of the headphone jack. But then mobile carriers like AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) and T-Mobile reported that iPhone 7 pre-orders were shooting through the roof. Sprint\u00a0Communications Inc said their orders were five times higher than last year\u2019s iPhone 6 orders. (Source: \u201cIPhone 7 preorders at Sprint are almost 5 times higher than last year\u2019s 6s,\u201d\u00a0CNBC, September 20, 2016.)\n\nOn top of all that, the company released a newer version of its operating system.\u00a0The new \u201ciOS\u201d platform\u00a0was upgraded at roughly the same time as the competing \u201cAndroid\u201d software, but customers responded very differently on each platform. Take a look at this stunning chart:\n\nMore than 34% of Apple\u2019s users jumped on board by updating the software and 60% are using the next most recent version. By contrast, less than 0.1% of Android users bothered to upgrade their software. In other words, Apple users are way more engaged with the company\u2019s products.\n\nThey buy iPhones, \u201ciPads,\u201d and \u201cMacbooks.\u201d All of their music is saved to \u201ciTunes.\u201d It\u2019s possible they even have \u201cApple TVs\u201d and \u201cApple Watches.\u201d The bottom line is that it\u2019s too difficult for these users to move out of Apple\u2019s ecosystem. It\u2019s too important to them, meaning that Apple stock isn\u2019t as vulnerable as analysts believe.", "category": "tech", "title": "AAPL Stock: Apple Inc.
