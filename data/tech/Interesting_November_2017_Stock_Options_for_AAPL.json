So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the November 2017 expiration for AAPL. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $95 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.45. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.7% return against the $95 commitment, or a 5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).\n\nTurning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the November 2017 expiration, for shareholders of Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $130 strike and collecting the premium based on the $4.95 bid, annualizes to an additional 3.8% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 5.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $130 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAPL shares would have to advance 15.2% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 19.6% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.", "category": "tech", "title": "Interesting November 2017 Stock Options for AAPL"}
