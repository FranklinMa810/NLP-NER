Apple Health senior engineer Mohan Randhava, who previously worked at Gliimpse, said recently that he's developing a platform that's expected to be a \"disruptive consumer healthcare application.\"\n\nAdditionally, Longbow upped its fiscal 2017 first-quarter iPhone unit shipment estimates by 2.5 million to 81.1 million, according to TheFly. Production trends appear to be stronger than expected, Longbow said.\n\nThe firm has a \"buy\" rating and $140 price target on Apple.\n\nApple's first quarter gross margin could beat expectations as a result of iPhone demand, positive mix changes and greater price concessions by suppliers, the firm noted.\n\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.
