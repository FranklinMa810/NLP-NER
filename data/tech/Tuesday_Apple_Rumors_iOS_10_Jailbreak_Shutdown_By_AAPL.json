(NASDAQ: ) rumor mill today is news of the tech company making it hard for an iOS 10 jailbreak to be released. Today, we\u2019ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday.\n\niOS 10 Jailbreak: Apple\u00a0users hoping to install the latest iOS 10 jailbreak are out of luck, reports Neurogadget. Hacker group\u00a0Pangu has released a jailbreak for iOS 10, but it\u2019s now useless. This is due to AAPL releasing\u00a0iOS 10.0.1 shortly after iOS 10 came out. This has set hackers back and it will take them time to release a new version of their iOS 10 jailbreak tool. The update will negate a previously installed jailbreak and the tool won\u2019t work on updated devices.\n\nNew Beta: Apple has released the second version of its\u00a0macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta to developers, MacRumors notes. The new beta is listed as build \u201c16B2333a\u201d and it comes about one week after the first beta of\u00a0macOS Sierra 10.12.1 was released. It can be downloaded from the company\u2019s\u00a0Developer Center and via the\u00a0Software Update feature\u00a0in the Mac App Store. The new beta is more focused on fixing bugs found in\u00a0macOS Sierra than it is in introducing new features.\n\nThree New Patents: Apple\u00a0has been granted three patents by the\u00a0U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, reports AppleInsider. The first patent is for an\u00a0\u201celectronic device with mapping circuitry\u201d that uses the various sensors in mobile devices to create a\u00a0depth map of an area around a person. The second patent is for a mechanical keyboard with touch capabilities. It describes a system where users could use keys for touch motions instead of having to use a trackpad. The final patent is for an optical connector. This would be a laser-based system that would allow users to connect accessories to devices, such as a keyboard to an iPad, without a physical connection. It also wouldn\u2019t rely off of Bluetooth and could consume less power.", "category": "tech", "title": "Tuesday Apple Rumors: iOS 10 Jailbreak Shutdown By AAPL"}
