Reuters notes that the 4.15% yield is well below that recently offered by other blue-chip multinationals like Intel on the island. The safer the bet, the lower the yield.\n\nThe bond is one of a number used by Apple to raise money to fund its stock buyback program and pay dividends while keeping its offshore stash of $233B out of the country to avoid the taxes that would be incurred by repatriating it. Other bond issues have taken place in the USA, Japan and Australia.\n\nApple has not yet officially confirmed the report.", "category": "tech", "title": "AAPL s rumored Taiwanese bond sale goes live, 30-year term with 4.15% yield"}
