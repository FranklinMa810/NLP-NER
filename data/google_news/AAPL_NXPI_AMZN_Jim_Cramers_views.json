We knew there was an outside chance the Fed could raise rates as soon as next week if we had a scorching retail sales number. That might have counteracted the punk ISM figures and been more in line with the excellent jobless claims we got this morning--best in about 40 years.\n\nBut a weak retail sales number dovetails with too much recent weak data, putting the onus on the hawks to justify why to move this soon without more data.\n\nApple (AAPL) ? Look, there's been a bear market around Apple and anything that comes near it: Skyworks (SWKS) , Qorvo (QRVO) , Cirrus Logic (CRUS) , but it's also put a damper on buying many other techs of late.\n\nSo you've got that delicious -- at least for the bulls -- combination of weaker macro numbers that allow you to buy all the bond market equivalent stocks while Apple inspires tech buying. I like Nvidia (NVDA) , Micron (MU) , Texas Instruments (TXN) and NXP Semi (NXPI) .
