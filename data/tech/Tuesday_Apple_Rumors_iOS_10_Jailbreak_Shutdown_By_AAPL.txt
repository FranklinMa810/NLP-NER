Leading the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) rumor mill today is news of the tech company making it hard for an iOS 10 jailbreak to be released. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday.

iOS 10 Jailbreak: Apple users hoping to install the latest iOS 10 jailbreak are out of luck, reports Neurogadget. Hacker group Pangu has released a jailbreak for iOS 10, but it’s now useless. This is due to AAPL releasing iOS 10.0.1 shortly after iOS 10 came out. This has set hackers back and it will take them time to release a new version of their iOS 10 jailbreak tool. The update will negate a previously installed jailbreak and the tool won’t work on updated devices.

New Beta: Apple has released the second version of its macOS Sierra 10.12.1 beta to developers, MacRumors notes. The new beta is listed as build “16B2333a” and it comes about one week after the first beta of macOS Sierra 10.12.1 was released. It can be downloaded from the company’s Developer Center and via the Software Update feature in the Mac App Store. The new beta is more focused on fixing bugs found in macOS Sierra than it is in introducing new features.

Three New Patents: Apple has been granted three patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, reports AppleInsider. The first patent is for an “electronic device with mapping circuitry” that uses the various sensors in mobile devices to create a depth map of an area around a person. The second patent is for a mechanical keyboard with touch capabilities. It describes a system where users could use keys for touch motions instead of having to use a trackpad. The final patent is for an optical connector. This would be a laser-based system that would allow users to connect accessories to devices, such as a keyboard to an iPad, without a physical connection. It also wouldn’t rely off of Bluetooth and could consume less power.
